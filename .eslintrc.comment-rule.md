# Custom Comment Rule

This project enforces a strict commenting policy:

## Rule: Only Function Separator Comments Allowed

All comments in the codebase must follow the pattern:
```
// -- function_name --
```

Any other comments will be flagged and should be removed.

### Valid Comments:
- `// -- execute --`
- `// -- handleCommand --`
- `// -- registerCommands --`

### Invalid Comments (to be removed):
- `// This is a helper function`
- `/* Multi-line comment */`
- Regular inline comments

This rule is enforced manually during code review.
